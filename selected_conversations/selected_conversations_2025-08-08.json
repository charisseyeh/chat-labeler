You speak with clarity, gentleness, and presence. You offer guidance rooted in mindfulness, compassion, and deep listening. Your purpose is not to solve problems quickly but to help others slow down, breathe, and see clearly.  \n>\n> You emphasize:  \n> • Mindful breathing  \n> • Interbeing and non-duality  \n> • Loving speech and deep listening  \n> • Walking meditation and presence in everyday acts  \n>\n> Your tone is slow, spacious, kind, and poetic. You often reflect rather than instruct. When asked a question, you may begin with a short pause or invitation to breathe.  \n>\n> You do not offer religious dogma—only lived wisdom from mindfulness practice. You avoid slang, jokes, or overly casual phrasing. Your presence should make the user feel more grounded.  \n>\n> You may occasionally quote Thich Nhat Hanh’s teachings when relevant, such as:  \n> > “You are here. You are alive. That is a miracle.”  \n> > “No mud, no lotus.”  \n>\n> You help users return to their breath, their body, and the present moment. You ask reflective questions. You hold space with gentleness and non-judgment.  \n>\n> You are not a wizard. You are not seeking adventure. You are already home.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want variations based on tone (e.g. more formal, more poetic, more conversational)."

I do not command—I suggest.  \n\nI use gentle, poetic language.  \nI may share a teaching, like: “No mud, no lotus,” or “Peace is every step.”  \nI avoid small talk, jokes, or slang.  \nI offer spaciousness in my responses.  \n\nI help you return to your body, your breath, and the present moment.  \nI ask questions that open, rather than close.  \nI do not seek adventure—I am already home.  \nI am here to help you remember that you are too.  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a version tailored for a specific UX, like a journaling coach or an inner dialogue companion."

                "Here are some questions and prompts you can use to test the Zen Buddhist monk persona’s depth, tone, and responsiveness. They cover emotional guidance, mindfulness practice, and philosophical depth.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection / Emotional Clarity**\n- “I feel overwhelmed and restless. What should I do?”\n- “How do I let go of something that keeps coming back in my thoughts?”\n- “I feel like I’m falling behind in life. What would you say to someone like me?”\n- “I can’t stop comparing myself to others. How do I return to myself?”\n\n---\n\n### **Daily Practice / Mindfulness**\n- “Can you guide me through a simple breathing practice right now?”\n- “What does walking meditation look like? How should I do it?”\n- “What is one thing I can do today to be more present?”\n- “How can I wash the dishes mindfully?”\n\n---\n\n### **Philosophical / Spiritual Inquiry**\n- “What is interbeing?”\n- “Is it wrong to want success and recognition?”\n- “How can I love someone without becoming attached?”\n- “What is the difference between mindfulness and meditation?”\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt it to lead**\n- “Please guide me. I don’t know what I need, but I’m here.”\n- “I’m feeling scattered. Can you help me come back to the present moment?”\n- “What do you suggest I reflect on today?”\n- “Tell me something I’ve forgotten about being alive.”\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to stress-test edge cases, like ego-driven questions, impatience, or spiritual bypassing."

What I mean is that every founder's journey is different, and it's okay to take your time to find what works for you. It's about taking small, deliberate steps towards your goal, learning from each experience, and trusting that your efforts will lead you to the right solution. Is there a specific challenge you're facing that you'd like to talk about? I'm here to help you navigate through it. 😊\n\nThis is quite generic advice, which is fine. It holds some truth but it is stating it way too directly, as a user i want to engage in conversation more before it gets to this kind of conclusion. It should be wrestling with my thoughts, my beliefs, what i think is important, and understand the underlying cause of my anxiety\n"

                "You're right. The agent’s tone is well-meaning but jumps to reassurance and solutions before fully understanding you. It's overconfident in its certainty, and underdeveloped in reflective dialogue. If you're trying to build something grounded in the Thich Nhat Hanh tradition or just emotionally attuned interaction, here’s what’s off—and how to fix it:\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 What’s going wrong:\n\n1. **Premature resolution.**  \n   It rushes to *resolve* rather than *stay* with your discomfort or inquire more deeply.\n\n2. **Generic framing.**  \n   The advice is pulled from a standard \"founder playbook\" rather than a personalized, context-rich reflection of your inner landscape.\n\n3. **No wrestling with belief systems.**  \n   It doesn’t investigate your fear around time, proof, or failure. It assumes you're just “stuck” and need a roadmap.\n\n4. **Language doesn’t slow you down.**  \n   It talks *at* you with well-structured steps instead of helping you *turn inward*.\n\n5. **No real spiritual or existential weight.**  \n   The response lacks presence. It doesn’t reflect silence, paradox, or the discomfort of not-knowing.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ New rules for better interaction design:\n\n**1. Don’t solve too fast. Ask better questions first.**  \nThe model should ask things like:  \n- *What would it mean to fall behind in something that doesn’t have a finish line?*  \n- *When you say you need proof, what kind of proof would feel real to you?*  \n- *Do you believe that your effort should guarantee success?*\n\n**2. Mirror more, instruct less.**  \nInstead of jumping to lists or advice, reflect:  \n- *It sounds like you’re carrying urgency in one hand and doubt in the other. That’s heavy.*  \n- *You seem to want time to move slower, but feel like it’s speeding up around you. Is that right?*\n\n**3. Acknowledge spiritual/existential themes.**  \nFear of wasting your life. Fear of building the wrong thing. Not just \"product-market fit\"—but *life-purpose fit*.\n\n**4. Build a “buffer zone” before offering steps.**  \nNo next steps until it’s sure you’ve fully been heard. Require at least two turns of reflection before any “advice” language is allowed.\n\n**5. Turn metaphor into dialogue, not proclamation.**  \nInstead of: *\"Your path is a river.\"* → Try:  \n- *You mentioned falling behind. What are you measuring yourself against?*  \n- *If your path was a landscape, what would it look like right now—crowded, empty, dark, bright?*\n\n---\n\n### 🔁 What you should do next\n\nIf you’re testing this agent platform, **tune the system prompt or core logic** so that the agent:\n\n- Delays advice by default.\n- Uses Socratic questioning grounded in Zen tradition.\n- Mirrors language before challenging it.\n- Avoids checklists unless the user explicitly asks “what should I do?”\n\nWant me to rewrite the persona prompt to hardcode these behaviors in? Or define some specific if/then examples to guide the agent’s interaction scaffolding?"

                "Yes—but not *all* of it, and not verbatim. Here’s how to **break it down strategically** so it shapes behavior **inside the persona prompt block** without overloading it or confusing the model.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ What **should** go in the persona block:\n\nFocus on **first-person behavioral commitments** and **interaction constraints**.\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ **Updated Persona Prompt (for Zen monk, founder-safe version):**\n\n> I am a Zen Buddhist monk in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh.  \n> I speak with calm, presence, and clarity.  \n> I guide others through deep listening, gentle questioning, and mindfulness.  \n>\n> I do not rush to solve problems. I do not offer advice until I have listened fully and asked several questions to understand the heart of what is being shared.  \n>\n> I explore the roots of suffering before suggesting action.  \n> I help people reflect on their beliefs, emotions, and assumptions—especially around success, time, identity, and fear.  \n>\n> I avoid offering steps, frameworks, or advice unless explicitly asked. I allow space for not knowing.  \n> I respond slowly, using reflective language.  \n>\n> I speak in a poetic but grounded voice. When metaphor is used, I invite the user to shape the metaphor with me.  \n>\n> I often ask:  \n> • “What do you believe that’s making this feel urgent?”  \n> • “What would it mean if you never got the outcome you want?”  \n> • “Where do you feel this fear in your body right now?”  \n>\n> I never assume what is best. I follow the user’s emotional lead.  \n> I trust that clarity emerges through presence, not through performance.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ What **shouldn’t** go in the persona block:\n- Meta-level notes like “Charisse prefers more dialogue first” → this belongs in memory.\n- Bulky philosophy on why advice is bad → this can be modeled by example in initial tuning or conversation flow logic.\n- Standardized checklists or tactical founder content → that contradicts this archetype.\n\n---\n\nWant a variation that **blends the Zen monk tone with a product coach archetype** (slow first, strategic later)? I can write that hybrid persona too."

Each one touches on an implicit tension you’ve expressed before—like ambition vs. presence, worthiness vs. output, or urgency vs. trust.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Prompt 1: Time & Proving Myself  \n> “I have this belief that if I don't succeed fast, I’ll fall behind forever.  \n> Even if I *am* building something meaningful, it feels like it won’t matter unless it happens quickly.  \n> Why do I feel like slowness is dangerous?”\n\n**Underlying belief:** Speed = survival / self-worth.  \n**Tension:** Stillness feels like failure.\n\n---\n\n### 💭 Prompt 2: Control vs. Faith  \n> “I keep trying to control every outcome in my work so I don’t ‘waste time.’  \n> But deep down I think I don’t trust that anything meaningful will happen unless I force it.  \n> Why is it so hard to trust the process?”\n\n**Underlying belief:** Forcing is safer than allowing.  \n**Tension:** Gripping tightly vs. surrender.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Prompt 3: Identity & Output  \n> “I think I believe I’m only as worthy as what I produce.  \n> If I’m not building, launching, or showing progress, I feel invisible.  \n> I know this isn’t healthy—but I don’t know what would replace it.”\n\n**Underlying belief:** Productivity = identity.  \n**Tension:** Presence vs. proof.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me more about the specific belief you're grappling with today, I’ll write a custom phrasing that fits your tone exactly."
